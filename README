INTRODUCTION
	myGifts enables you, your family, your friends to share your gift wish-lists.
	Every user can:
		- add gifts to his list or to other people's list,
		- decide who can(cannot) see this or that gift,
		- view other people's lists,
		- claim gifts on other lists.
	Users belong to groups. One can only see lists from people of the same groups.

PREREQUISITES
	PHP >= 4.2.3
	mySQL 3 or 4.x (optional with PHP5)

INSTALL (SIMPLE)
	- untar myGifts.x.x.tar.gz in your web server's document root.
		tar xvfpz myGifts.x.x.tar.gz
	- check that your web server
	- create a mysql database (unless you already have one) or use sqlite if not (PHP5 only)
	- launch http://votresiteweb/myGifts/setup.php in your browser
	- select a language
	- configure your database access
	- create a "admin" user

Note : if you transfer the myGifts files to your web server trough FTP, you will
have to check that your web server can write to the myGifts/config directory
("group" and "other" write permissions are needed).
If that is not the case, the installer will advise you to create the config file
by yourself.

ADDITIONNAL INSTALL (POWER USERS)
	- change the rights of the file : config/config.inc.php
		cd myGifts/config
		mv config.inc.php config.save.php
		cp config.save.php config.inc.php

UPGRADE
	If you upgrade from version 0.9, execute the sql script setup/upgrade-0.9.sql
	If you upgrade from version 1.22, execute the sql script setup/upgrade-1.22.sql
	If you upgrade from another version, the database upgrade is automatically performed.
	You must remove the $setup = array( ... ); part from config/config.inc.php, as the
	corresponding setup is now managed through the admin web pages.
	
SECURITY
	By default, the cache and config directories have 777 permissions. If you think this is bad security,
	You should do :
		chown -R `whoami` config
		chmod 755 config
		chmod 644 config/*

	myGifts is meant to run with safe_mode=On, register_globals=Off configured in your php.ini
	(if you don't know what this is, don't be afraid, it will work on your configuration).
